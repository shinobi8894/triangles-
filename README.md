Given length of sides of equilateral triangle (s), and velocities(v) of each animal tagged on the vertices of triangle, find out the time after which they meet, if they start moving towards their right opposite, forming a trajectory.
```
Input : s = 2, v = 5
Output : 0.266667

Input : s = 11, v = 556
